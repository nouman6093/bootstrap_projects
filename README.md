## FAQ

#### Should we use just bootstrap instead of html, css and js?

No, bootstrap is not a replacement for html, css and js. infact around 79% websites in the world don't even use bootstrap. it is useful only if you have a near deadline to meet for your client.

#### Are you serious about bootstrap?

No, i am not serious about bootstrap i am doing it only as a side knowledge. as an IT student we should know all the tools including this one.
